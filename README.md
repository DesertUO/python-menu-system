# Python Menu System

This is my first project (library). Itâ€™s a customizable command-line menu system for Python applications, created as part of my path to gain experience and learn how to code more effectively. This project provides a framework for creating interactive menus with easy navigation.

## Features
- Dynamic menu creation based on provided functions
- Clear console display
- User-friendly prompts and confirmation messages
- Option to repeat actions or return to the main menu

## Installation
To install the library.....

1. Download from PyPI:
   `pip install ...`
2. Use it on your :
   `cd python-menu-system`

## Example usage
In the github repository `https://github.com/DesertUO/python-menu-system`
The `main.py` file under `examples` demonstrates how to use the menu system. It contains example functions and initializes the menu. To see it in action, execute the following command: `python -m examples.main`

## Customization
You can easily customize the menu by:

1. Creating your own functions like the the `functions` list in `main.py`.
2. Etc.
