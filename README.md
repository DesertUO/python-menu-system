# Python Menu System

This is my first project. Itâ€™s a customizable command-line menu system for Python applications, created as part of my path to gain experience and learn how to code more effectively. This project provides a framework for creating interactive menus with easy navigation.

## Features
- Dynamic menu creation based on provided functions
- Clear console display
- User-friendly prompts and confirmation messages
- Option to repeat actions or return to the main menu

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/placeholder/placeholder.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   `cd python-menu-system`

## Example usage
The `main.py` file demonstrates how to use the menu system. It contains example functions and initializes the menu. To see it in action, execute the following command:
   `python main.py`

This example demonstrates how to set up functions and integrate them into the menu. Feel free to modify it and add your own functions!

## Customization
You can easily customize the menu by:

1. Adding your own functions to the `functions` list in `main.py`.
2. Running the script to test your changes.
